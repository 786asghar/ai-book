# Physical AI & Robotics Bootcamp

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Robotics Bootcamp**! This comprehensive course will take you on a journey through the fascinating world of robotics, simulation, and embodied intelligence. Whether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned developer looking to transition into robotics, this bootcamp is designed to take you from fundamental concepts to building your own agentic robotic systems.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the real world through physical agents, such as robots. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI must perceive, reason, and act in three-dimensional environments with real-world physics and constraints. This field combines robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and control theory to create intelligent agents that can operate in our physical world.

### Why This Course?

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, robotics is becoming increasingly important in fields ranging from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and domestic assistance. Understanding how to create and deploy intelligent robotic systems is becoming a critical skill.

This bootcamp is unique because it covers the entire stack of robotics development:
- **Software foundations** (ROS2)
- **Simulation environments** (Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim)
- **Embodied intelligence** (Vision-Language-Action agents)
- **Practical implementation** (hands-on labs and capstone projects)

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will have mastered:

1. **ROS2 Fundamentals**: Learn the Robot Operating System framework that powers most modern robotics projects
2. **Simulation Mastery**: Create realistic robotic simulations using both Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
3. **Embodied AI**: Understand and implement Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents that can understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks
4. **Full-Stack Robotics**: Build complete robotics pipelines from perception through planning to control

### Course Structure

The bootcamp is organized into four major modules, each building upon the previous one:

- **Module 1**: ROS2 Foundations - Establishing the software backbone
- **Module 2**: Gazebo Simulation - Creating realistic simulation environments  
- **Module 3**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim - Advanced physics-based simulation
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action Agents - Creating intelligent robotic agents

### Prerequisites

This course is designed for learners with:
- Basic programming knowledge (especially Python)
- Familiarity with Linux environments
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus concepts
- Eagerness to learn robotics and AI

No prior robotics experience is required!

### Learning Approach

This bootcamp follows a **learn-by-doing** approach. Each module contains:
- Theoretical foundations
- Practical hands-on laboratories
- Real-world examples
- Problem-solving exercises
- Capstone integration projects

Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of Physical AI and Robotics!
